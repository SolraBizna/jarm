* Implement LDREX*/STREX*, unprivileged load/store


The simple and compound loads/stores, and MOV, are not tested. This is because they have received by far the most manual testing. It is also believed that if they were wrong, much more code would be failing. (Also, I'm lazy.)

MVN is not tested as it is trivial.

The coprocessor instructions are not tested, because they are coprocessor-specific. The "sane" forms have been thoroughly tested manually.

Straightforward MRS and MSR are not tested because their operation is trivial, and critical to startup code success. If they were not working, programs would not boot.
